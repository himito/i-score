 *
 * - prepareNewDocument is called for all plug-ins.
 *
 * - Creation of a Document.
 * - Creation of a DocumentModel
 * - on_initDocument is called for all plug-ins.
 *
 * * New document case :
 * - The document delegate is created

 * - The document delegate is loaded
 * - The SerializableDocumentPlugin are loaded (see

 * - on_loadedDocument is called for all plug-ins.
 *
 * Finally, on_createdDocument is called for all plug-ins.
 * If the document becomes visible, on_documentChanged is called for all
