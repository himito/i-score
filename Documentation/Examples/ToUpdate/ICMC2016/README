To run this demo locally : 

First install nodejs, npm, and run the following command.

    $ npm install nodejs-websocket

Then run the server : 

    $ node icmc-server.js

Then you can open index.html in a web browser.
If the server runs correctly, a randomly generated name in colour should appear.

Afterwards you can run i-score and adjust the midi device (tata) to use the midi port
that you want.
